    <h3>How Web applications work</h3>
    <p>Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can access a Web application through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.</p>
    <p>For a web app to operate, it needs a Web server, application server, and a database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database can be used to store any needed information.</p>
    <p>Web applications typically have short development cycles and can be made with small development teams. Most Web apps are written in JavaScript, HTML5, or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Client-side programming typically utilizes these languages, which help build an applications front-end. Server-side programming is done to create the scripts a Web app will use. Languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby are commonly used in server-side programming.</p>
